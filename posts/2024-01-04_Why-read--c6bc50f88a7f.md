Reading is crucial for cognitive development, justifying the inclusion of classics in education, despite the resistance from some non-educators who seek content more geared towards “high fantasy” for young audiences.

Additionally, the absorption of knowledge varies widely from person to person — be it through images, text, or writing. There is extensive research on this. Learning is an individual and diverse process, aligned with the theory of “multiple intelligences,” where each individual has their own learning style. Contemporary pedagogical approaches emphasize the “proximal zone,” which implies learning by teaching. Hence, the proliferation of educational videos on YouTube.

Reading is an active act that enhances not only written communication but also expands vocabulary, enabling clearer and more structured communication. The ability to organize thoughts is scarce, reflected in the number of confusing texts on the internet.

The crux is the supposed quality of what is read. I have a personal scale of quality, ranging from Brazilian classics such as “**Grande Sertão: Veredas,” “Água Viva,” “Hora da Estrela,” “Rosa do Povo,” “Caminhando na Chuva,” “Contos Gaúchescos,” “Os Sertões,” “Lavoura Arcaica,” “Torto Arado,” “Avesso da Pele,” “Casa de Despejo”**, among others, to international classics like **Kafka, Dostoievski, Jack London, Flaubert**, and an extensive list. These works are fundamental in human formation. Non-fiction books, such as **“Raízes do Brasil,” “Formação Econômica do Brasil,” “Casa Grande e Senzala,” “Balas de Washington,” “O Estado Empreendedor,” “Luta de Classes na Alemanha,” “Programa de Gotha,” “O Capital,” “Máscaras Negras,**” significantly contribute to empathy, especially in South America.

Some films and documentaries may offer similar perspectives, but achieving the same depth of a subject through television media is challenging, considering the competition with different genres.

On the other hand, fantasy books, such as **“The Lord of the Rings” and works by Brandon Sanderson**, despite being beloved, are primarily for entertainment. Although not less important, they differ in this aspect. Entertainment is vital — leisure, distraction are essential elements for personal and professional enhancement, keeping our critical capacity sharp. These books are the equivalent, in the literary world, of action and horror movies in streaming.

In conclusion, reading, video games, and television (streaming) complement each other in cognitive development, each contributing in a distinct way. All these works shape our worldview, influencing behaviors and reactions to our surroundings.

**Well, Ethan Hawke onse said ...**

Most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about poetry, right?
They have a life to live and they're not really that concerned with
Allen Ginsberg's poems or anybody's poems.
Until their father dies.
They go to a funeral.
You lose a child.
Somebody breaks your heart.
They don't love you anymore.
And all of a sudden you're desperate for making sense out of this life.
And has anybody ever felt this bad before?
How did they come out of this cloud?
Or the inverse, something great.
You meet somebody and your heart explodes.
You love them so much you can't even see straight.
You know, you're dizzy.
Did anybody feel like this before?
What is happening to me?
And that's when art is not a luxury.
It's actually sustenance.
We need it.
Okay, well, what is it?
Human creativity is nature manifest in us.
And I believe that we are here on this star in space to try to help one another, right?
And first we have to survive and then we have to thrive and to thrive, to express ourselves.
All right, well, here's the road.
We have to know ourselves.
What do you love?
And if you get close to what you love, who you are is revealed to you and it expands.
We know this.
The time of our life is so short and how we spend it.
Are we spending it doing what's important to us?
Most of us not.
I mean, it's hard.
It's the pull of habit is so huge.
And that's what makes kids so beautifully creative, is that they don't have any habits, and they don't care if they're any good or not, right?
So if you want to help your community, if you want to help your family, if you want to help your friends, you have to express yourself.
To express yourself, you have to know yourself.
It's actually super easy.
You just have to follow your love.
There is no path.
There's no path till you walk it and you have to be willing to play the fool.
Because I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important.
And that's really the enemy because it's not up to us whether what we do is any good.
And if history's taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.

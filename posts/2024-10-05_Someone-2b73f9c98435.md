One of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know.

> One of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know.

> Someone in your class finds your presence inviting and warm, even if you’ve only exchanged a few words with them, or maybe none at all.

> Someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks.

> Someone you used to be friends with still wishes to fondly call your name. And someone you were friends with five years ago would give anything to be in the same room as you today.

> Someone who regularly comes into work is disappointed when you aren’t there to brighten their day. Someone missed you today.

> Someone noticed when you were gone.

> Someone loves you when you’re there.

> Someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all.

> You may think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you’ve never left the frame.

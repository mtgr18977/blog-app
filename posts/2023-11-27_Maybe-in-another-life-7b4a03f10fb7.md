### Maybe in another life

#### I do not know we wrote this.

Run Guts.

(…)

I need you to do something for me

I need you to let me go

You have to let me let you go

In another life

Maybe it was you and me

Maybe there we loved each other right

And we were happy together

Maybe in that life we did all the things we said we would

But we got this one instead

You were my friend, my love and now a stranger

But you always be my favorite memory

In this life

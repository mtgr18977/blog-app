### Maybe, it is our end.

Anyone in Brazil is aware of the major flood currently happening in Porto Alegre. It’s the largest on record, surpassing even the famous and, until now, unthinkable flood of 1941, which led to the construction of the Mauá wall in Rio Grande do Sul. Prior to this, there were at least three strong climatic events here: the drought in the summer of 2022/2023, the flood in the Taquari Valley in September 2023, and the major heat bubble in January 2022. All these events occurred in Rio Grande do Sul at some point; however, until 2022, such events were considered extremely rare and thus treated as major climatic exceptions.

At the same time, Dubai has experienced the largest flood ever recorded in the Middle East; China is currently facing the worst flooding since the Yellow River floods of 1931; Texas is counting the dead from the greatest flood of the century; and Kenya is being obliterated by an unprecedented series of floods.

It is safe to say that we are currently at the point of actual change. This is the moment when the planet has decided that our capitalist-extractive society needs to be phased out. We failed to extinguish it; perhaps the planet will succeed. And perhaps we will realize that the problem has never been humans per se, but rather the predatory-exploitative system of capitalism.

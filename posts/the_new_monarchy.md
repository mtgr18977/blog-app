A while back, when it was said that anarcho-capitalism was the new feudalism, a lone voice spoke up and said no, that feudalism had more merit than the current neoliberal-ancap system, and that, given the hereditary characteristics of the liberal system, what most closely resembles our system historically is monarchy.

It wasn’t me who said this, but I agree. Let’s evaluate the list of Brazilian billionaires from FORBES by grouping them by families and adding up their wealth.

Moreira Salles family:
* Fernando Roberto Moreira Salles — US$ 7.6 billion
* Pedro Moreira Salles — US$ 7.1 billion
* João Moreira Salles — US$ 5.3 billion
* Walther Moreira Salles Junior — US$ 5.3 billion
* Total: US$ 25.3 billion

Batista family:
* Joesley Batista — US$ 3.3 billion
* Wesley Batista — US$ 3.3 billion
* Total: US$ 6.6 billion

Marinho family:
* João Roberto Marinho — US$ 2.1 billion
* José Roberto Marinho — US$ 2.1 billion
* Roberto Irineu Marinho — US$ 2 billion
* Total: US$ 6.2 billion

Feffer family:
* David Feffer — US$ 1.6 billion
* Jose Roberto Ermirio de Moraes — US$ 1.5 billion
* Jose Ermirio de Moraes Neto — US$ 1.5 billion
* Daniel Feffer — US$ 1.5 billion
* Jorge Feffer — US$ 1.5 billion
* Ruben Feffer — US$ 1.5 billion
* Total: US$ 9.1 billion

Grendene Bartelle family:
* Alexandre Grendene Bartelle — US$ 2.6 billion
* Pedro Grendene Bartelle — US$ 1.1 billion
* Total: US$ 3.7 billion

Voigt family:
* Eduardo Voigt Schwartz — US$ 1.3 billion
* Mariana Voigt Schwartz Gomes — US$ 1.3 billion
* Livia Voigt — US$ 1.1 billion
* Dora Voigt de Assis — US$ 1.1 billion
* Total: US$ 4.8 billion

The distribution of wealth among Brazilian billionaires is a slap in the face to the course-selling coaches (not that they care about it). It’s surreal to see so much money in the hands of so few, while the majority struggle to get by.

From a Marxist-Leninist perspective, this mountain of money that the billionaires have is the result of the exploitation of workers. The people who do the hard work receive a pittance of what they actually produce, and the rest goes into the pockets of big business owners. This creates an abyss between those who work and those who hold the capital, keeping the exploitation machine running at full steam.

This concentration of wealth with a few individuals with German-sounding surnames is a clear sign that late capitalism has reached that point where either we have a revolution or we’re going to die melting on Earth while they head off to space (literally).

It’s not just a matter of money, but also of power. The billionaires have a huge influence on the economy and politics, using it to keep things the way they like.

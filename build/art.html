            <p><strong>Well, Ethan Hawke onse said ...</strong></p>
<p>Most people don&#39;t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry, right?<br>They have a life to live and they&#39;re not really that concerned with<br>Allen Ginsberg&#39;s poems or anybody&#39;s poems.<br>Until their father dies.<br>They go to a funeral.<br>You lose a child.<br>Somebody breaks your heart.<br>They don&#39;t love you anymore.<br>And all of a sudden you&#39;re desperate for making sense out of this life.<br>And has anybody ever felt this bad before?<br>How did they come out of this cloud?<br>Or the inverse, something great.<br>You meet somebody and your heart explodes.<br>You love them so much you can&#39;t even see straight.<br>You know, you&#39;re dizzy.<br>Did anybody feel like this before?<br>What is happening to me?<br>And that&#39;s when art is not a luxury.<br>It&#39;s actually sustenance.<br>We need it.<br>Okay, well, what is it?<br>Human creativity is nature manifest in us.<br>And I believe that we are here on this star in space to try to help one another, right?<br>And first we have to survive and then we have to thrive and to thrive, to express ourselves.<br>All right, well, here&#39;s the road.<br>We have to know ourselves.<br>What do you love?<br>And if you get close to what you love, who you are is revealed to you and it expands.<br>We know this.<br>The time of our life is so short and how we spend it.<br>Are we spending it doing what&#39;s important to us?<br>Most of us not.<br>I mean, it&#39;s hard.<br>It&#39;s the pull of habit is so huge.<br>And that&#39;s what makes kids so beautifully creative, is that they don&#39;t have any habits, and they don&#39;t care if they&#39;re any good or not, right?<br>So if you want to help your community, if you want to help your family, if you want to help your friends, you have to express yourself.<br>To express yourself, you have to know yourself.<br>It&#39;s actually super easy.<br>You just have to follow your love.<br>There is no path.<br>There&#39;s no path till you walk it and you have to be willing to play the fool.<br>Because I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important.<br>And that&#39;s really the enemy because it&#39;s not up to us whether what we do is any good.<br>And if history&#39;s taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.</p>

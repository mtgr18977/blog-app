<h3>Why the tech media taste all the same?</h3>

<p>For a more detailed analysis, it is proposed to segment the market into technological subsets: computational technology (phones, computers, televisions, peripherals); social technology (technological influence on society, our relationship with it, the impact of algorithms); automotive technology; and market technology (Musk, B3, NASDAQ, cryptocurrencies).</p>
<p>This segmentation is already applied in various areas of human knowledge. It may be beneficial to adopt it in the technological field as well.</p>
<p>My concern is not with generalist sites like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">Verge</a> or <a href="https://www.404media.co/">404</a>, but with those formatted exclusively for Google SEO.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in how Google, especially through its search engine and YouTube, has influenced post-2010 society in political, educational, entertainment, and consumption aspects. Google’s influence over the last 14 years is noteworthy, as is that of Facebook and WhatsApp, especially in Brazil and India.</p>
<p>Discussing the social implications of technology, in my view, is more relevant than focusing solely on products like iPhone, Android, or macOS. However, I recognize the need to adapt to the market and to the demands of the algorithm or target audience. Initiatives like Ghedin’s and MdU’s, which separate these topics into <a href="https://manualdousuario.net/orbita/">Órbita</a>, are commendable, offering a complementary perspective to the distinct discussions found on platforms like <a href="https://www.tabnews.com.br/">Felipe Deschamps’ TabNews</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, considering the ubiquity of technology in society, it is vital to develop specific fields of study to analyze it from a theoretical and well-founded perspective.</p>

      <p>Sunday night, May 26, 2024, displayed a country that humiliated the civilized world in a startling way. The mass annihilation and the genocidal conduct committed are abhorrent acts of cruelty.</p>
<p>After complaining that they were being likened to Hamas, Netanyahu and Gallant have now shown to be even more despicable: they stand for a legal state that has chosen to commit intentional killings. The most heinous act of disrespect for human life is an airstrike directed on tents within a refugee camp. The killings are proof of the shamelessness and hate of genocidal acts.</p>
<p>Joe Biden&#39;s signature appears on the munitions that the US supplied. The US president and his nation ought to be on the list of those subject to arrest orders by the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice in order to put an end to the Palestinian genocide in Gaza.</p>
<p>Although I disagree with the notion of showing Palestinian women and children being torn apart by Israeli jets, it is necessary to depict this horrific truth in order to make the world aware of the severity of the atrocities.</p>
<p>The globe felt worse when it woke up on Monday. Israel must be stopped by all means before they can finish the Holocaust on the Palestinian people. The IDF prosecutor, Major General Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi, acknowledged on May 27, 2024, that she had opened an inquiry into over 70 incidents of Palestinian people being tortured and killed in detention camps in the Negev desert. As a result, the situation is expected to worsen.</p>
<p>Gadi Eisenkot, a politician and observer in the war cabinet and a former commander of the Israel Defense Forces, told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that Israel need to halt its attack in Rafah until the captives are freed through a deal with Hamas. </p>
<p>Negotiations are unlikely to proceed after this tragedy, though, considering Netanyahu&#39;s stubbornness in prioritizing his political survival over the lives of the captives.</p>
<p>Using all available force is necessary to prevent Israel&#39;s extreme right, represented by Ben Gvir and Smotrich, who rejoiced over the slaughter, from continuing down this path of lunacy. Palestine merits our solidarity and help in the fight against these crimes.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be honest and put on my movie critic&#39;s wallet (I haven&#39;t acted in about 12 years) and say that “Anora” is a very good movie, but at the same time very ordinary. It&#39;s worth it for Mikey Madison&#39;s performance, which is really good for what the movie proposes. But she&#39;s no better than Demi Moore and ties with the performances of Fernanda Torres and Cynthia Erivo. </p>
<p>Didn&#39;t Sean Baker deserve any of his Oscars? I don&#39;t think so, but from this cycle, the best movie is still “Conclave” and the best actress is still Demi Moore. </p>
<p>However, this is the kind of movie that engages. Mikey Madison even won the BAFTA, showing that it was a trend for her to win awards. To be honest, the most inconsistent thing is Sean Baker winning director and original screenplay, because both had people who, in this cycle, did better work. Those two awards not going to Coralie Fargeat are two very absurd things to me. And Jacques Audiard was in the slot that should have gone to Walter Sales. Just as the Oscar for Best Actor didn&#39;t go to Colman Domingo or Ralph Fiennes, both of whom were better in their roles than Adrien Brody. Still on the subject of actors, Timothée Chalamet was very good (and won the SAG), even though the BAFTA also went to Adrien Brody. </p>
<p>And finally, for me the biggest injustice with “I&#39;m Still Here” is that it wasn&#39;t even nominated for adapted screenplay and direction. Walter Salles was good in his direction (although “Central Station” is a better film than the latter in terms of acting, editing, photography and script) and the screenplay was adapted very well by Murilo Hauser. I don&#39;t know if it could compete with “Conclave”, but being in the top 5 was almost an obligation.</p>

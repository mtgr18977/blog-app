            <p>If someone asks you for a summary and you don’t know how to explain it in scientific terms, you can paraphrase Thomas Sankara’s quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is the system where you have to decide whether a minority drinks champagne or everyone has access to drinking water.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it’s still not clear, you can tell them the story of the former revolutionary leader of Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, from 1983 to 1987:</p>
<ul>
<li>He launched a national literacy campaign.</li>
<li>Built railroads, roads, and housing.</li>
<li>Banned female genital mutilation, forced marriages, and polygamy.</li>
<li>Expanded women’s rights and access to education. He also appointed women to high-level positions in his government.</li>
<li>Redistributed land to peasant farmers.</li>
<li>Vaccinated over 2 million children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles, saving 18,000 to 50,000 children’s lives annually.</li>
<li>Built schools, health centers, water dams, and provided free access to everyone in the country.</li>
<li>Suspended rural taxes and house rents.</li>
<li>Planted over 10 million trees to combat desertification.</li>
<li>Reduced the infant mortality rate from 208 per 1,000 births to ~100.</li>
<li>Refused to submit to the IMF and the World Bank.</li>
</ul>
<p>A reader of Marx and Engels and a jazz guitarist, Sankara was assassinated by his former friend in a coup with the help of the French government. A right-wing dictatorship friendly to the French was installed. Much of the progress Sankara made in power was undone during this period. Many believe that the coup happened because Sankara, a pan-Africanist, was fighting for African countries to unite and refuse to pay the debt that colonizing nations, like France, had imposed on them.</p>
<p>Sankara was known for his charisma and his commitment to social justice. He was a vocal critic of colonialism and neocolonialism, and he called for a united and independent Africa. Sankara’s legacy is still debated today. Some see him as a hero and a visionary leader, while others criticize his authoritarian methods. However, there is no doubt that he had a profound impact on Burkina Faso and on the African continent.</p>

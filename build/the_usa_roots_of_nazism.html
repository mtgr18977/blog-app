            <p>Few people know, but Nazism was born in the United States (a country that, much like liberals, always manages to escape the consequences of its own mess).</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1924, <em>Correspondance Internationale</em> (the French version of the Communist International&#39;s publication) featured an article written by a young Indochinese immigrant living in the United States. In it, he expressed great admiration for American development while simultaneously being horrified by the practice of lynching Black people in the South. One such mass spectacle is described starkly in the text: &quot;The Black man is boiled, flamed, and burned, for he must die twice instead of once. He is then hanged, or more accurately, what remains of his body is strung up... When everyone has had their fill, the corpse is taken down. The rope is then cut into small pieces, each of which is sold for three to five dollars.&quot; However, the denunciation of the white supremacy system did not imply a wholesale condemnation of the United States: the Ku Klux Klan had all &quot;the brutality of fascism&quot;, but it would be defeated not only by Black people, Jews, and Catholics (all victims to varying degrees) but also by &quot;all decent Americans.&quot;</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>&quot;If the Depression had not hit Germany so hard, National Socialism might today be regarded as the Klan sometimes is: a historical curiosity predestined to fail.&quot;</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The author, Géza von Hoffmann, vice-consul of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Chicago, praised North America for its &quot;lucidity&quot; and &quot;pure practical reason&quot; demonstrated in confronting, with the necessary energy, a very important problem often ignored: in the United States, violating laws prohibiting interracial sexual relations and marriage could be punished with ten years in prison. Not only could those responsible for such acts be pursued and condemned, but so could their accomplices. (8) Even after the Nazis came to power, their ideologues and &quot;scientists&quot; of race continued to insist: &quot;Germany has much to learn from the measures adopted by the Americans: they do what must be done.&quot;</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the notion of a &quot;final solution&quot; regarding the Black question appeared in the United States long before it did in Germany, in a book published in Boston in 1913. (10) This idea was later carried out by the Nazis, using the same term (<em>Endlösung</em>) to resolve the &quot;Jewish question.&quot;</p>
